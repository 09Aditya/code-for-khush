**Date Invitation Webpage**

    This project is a fun and interactive webpage that invites someone on a date with a playful twist. The page is styled using CSS, and JavaScript is used to add       interactive behavior.

**Project Structure**

    *HTML File (index.html): The structure of the webpage.
    *CSS File (style.css): The styling and layout of the webpage.
    *JavaScript File (script.js): The interactivity logic for the webpage.

**How It Works**

1). HTML (index.html):

The webpage has a simple structure with a title, a question, and two buttons ("Yes" and "No").
It also includes an image (GIF) to make the invitation more engaging.
The buttons allow the user to respond to the question.

CSS (style.css):

The styling is done to center the content on the page and style the buttons.
The h2 tag for the question is styled to make it stand out.
The buttons are styled with different colors and positions to make the interaction more engaging.
JavaScript (script.js):

If the user clicks "Yes", the question changes to a positive response, and a celebratory GIF is displayed.
If the user tries to click "No", the "No" button moves to a random position on the screen, making it difficult to click.
